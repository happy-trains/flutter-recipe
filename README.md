# Recipe <img src="assets/recipe-transparent.png" alt="logo" width="40" height="40"> [![Codemagic build status][hello-world]][latest-build]
A multi-platform app which targets mobile, web, and desktop using the Flutter framework.

# Goals
 **Collaboration** is the  first and foremost goal of this project, followed by:
- Creating a showcase for the [Typsense dart client][pub] by using the existing indexed data of the [recipe-search showcase][recipe-search] for the search feature.
- Achieving maximum code reusability across the supported platforms.
- CI/CD using [Codemagic][codemagic].

# Non-Goals
Since the project is focused solely on the search functionality, not much emphasis would be given to:
- UI/UX
- Themes
